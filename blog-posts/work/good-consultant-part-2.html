        <div class="content">
            <p>Welcome to the second part of my top 10 list about the skills that will help you to become a successful EWM consultant. In <a href="good-consultant-part-1.html" target="_blank">Part 1</a>, I covered the technical and functional skills that form the foundation for EWM consultants – business processes, EWM-specific knowledge, ABAP, ERP processes, and process documentation. Now let's move into soft skills that build upon this foundation.</p>

            <p>Now I invite you to read on, as I am presenting tips 6 to 10 that I consider valuable and important to become a good and successful EWM consultant.</p>

            <strong>6. Communication skills</strong>

            <div class="screenshot-container">
                <img src="../../assets/images/work/good-consultant/Become%20a%20good%20SAP%20EWM%20consultant_06.png" alt="Communication skills" width="800" height="450" loading="lazy">
            </div>
            
            <p>Communication is the foundation of successful consulting. You'll constantly explain concepts to different stakeholders—from operational managers to technical developers. The ability to break down complex SAP EWM topics into understandable language for various audiences is crucial.</p>

            <p>In my experience, the most effective consultants are those who can adapt their communication style. When explaining a process to business users, focus on outcomes and business value. When working with developers, dive into technical details. In stakeholder meetings, emphasize risks and benefits to the business. This flexibility prevents misunderstandings and builds trust across your project teams.</p>

            <p>Invest time in improving your written and verbal communication. Clear documentation, concise emails, and effective presentations are invaluable skills. If English is not your native language, don't be discouraged. Many international projects benefit from diverse perspectives, and most colleagues will appreciate your effort to communicate clearly. Take courses, practice public speaking, and seek feedback from colleagues to continuously improve.</p>

            <strong>7. Problem-solving mindset</strong>

            <div class="screenshot-container">
                <img src="../../assets/images/work/good-consultant/Become%20a%20good%20SAP%20EWM%20consultant_07.png" alt="Problem-solving" width="800" height="450" loading="lazy">
            </div>
            
            <p>EWM projects are rarely straightforward. You will encounter requirements that don't fit standard functionality, system integration challenges, and business processes that need refinement. A problem-solving mindset is what sets good consultants apart from great ones.</p>

            <p>Approach problems systematically. When faced with a challenge, resist the urge to jump to the first solution. Instead, take time to understand the root cause. Ask "why" multiple times. Is it a system limitation, a configuration issue, a business process gap, or a user expectation problem? Once you understand the real issue, brainstorm multiple solutions before committing to one.</p>

            <p>Learn to balance perfection with pragmatism. Not every solution needs to be perfect; sometimes a good solution is delivered on time better than a perfect one delivered late. At the same time, don't compromise on quality in areas where it matters. Develop judgment about which trade-offs are acceptable and which are not.</p>

            <p>Finally, keep detailed notes about challenges you've faced and how you solved them. Create your own knowledge base. Over time, you'll recognize patterns and patterns will help you solve new problems faster. What seemed like a complex problem on your first project might be routine by your fifth project dealing with similar challenges.</p>

            <strong>8. Humility</strong>

            <div class="screenshot-container">
                <img src="../../assets/images/work/good-consultant/Become%20a%20good%20SAP%20EWM%20consultant_08.png" alt="Humility" width="800" height="450" loading="lazy">
            </div>
            
            <p>EWM is complex. Even after years of experience, you won't know everything. Accepting this fact and approaching each project with humility is essential.</p>

            <p>When you don't know something, say so. Your stakeholders will respect your honesty more than pretended expertise. Saying "I don't know, but I'll find out" followed by delivering the answer is far better than making up an answer that turns out to be wrong.</p>

            <p>Avoid overconfidence, especially in early parts of projects. What looks simple on the surface often has hidden complexity. A process that worked perfectly in one company might have edge cases in another. Users might have workarounds that aren't documented. System configurations might have undocumented customizations. Approach each requirement with a mindset of discovery rather than assuming you already know the answer.</p>

            <p>Be open to learning from others. Your colleagues might have insights you lack. Business users often have deep process knowledge. Even junior team members might spot issues that experienced consultants miss. Humility creates a culture of collaborative problem-solving where everyone contributes their best ideas.</p>

            <strong>9. Build network and help others</strong>

            <div class="screenshot-container">
                <img src="../../assets/images/work/good-consultant/Become%20a%20good%20SAP%20EWM%20consultant_09.png" alt="Networking" width="800" height="450" loading="lazy">
            </div>
            
            <p>The EWM community is relatively small. Building and maintaining a strong professional network is invaluable. Attend conferences, participate in online forums, connect with colleagues on LinkedIn, and engage in the SAP EWM ecosystem.</p>

            <p>More importantly, be generous with your knowledge. Share your experiences on blogs, answer questions in forums, mentor junior consultants, and help colleagues when they're stuck. This generosity creates a positive reputation and builds goodwill. What goes around comes around—when you're stuck on a problem, others will be more willing to help if you've been helpful to them.</p>

            <p>Networking isn't just transactional. Build genuine relationships with people in the EWM space. These relationships become valuable for collaboration, learning, and often lead to interesting new opportunities. Some of the best projects I've been involved in came through referrals from colleagues I had helped years earlier.</p>

            <p>Also, remember that helping others doesn't diminish your value as a consultant. Some consultants worry that sharing knowledge will make them less valuable. In reality, the opposite is true. Generous consultants build stronger reputations, attract better projects, and create more opportunities for themselves long-term.</p>

            <strong>10. Take care of your well-being</strong>

            <div class="screenshot-container">
                <img src="../../assets/images/work/good-consultant/Become%20a%20good%20SAP%20EWM%20consultant_10.png" alt="Well-being" width="800" height="450" loading="lazy">
            </div>
            
            <p>Consulting is demanding. Long hours, tight deadlines, challenging problems, and the pressure to deliver results can take a toll if you're not careful. Protecting your mental and physical health is not a luxury—it's essential for a sustainable career.</p>

            <p>Make exercise a non-negotiable part of your routine. It doesn't have to be intense—a daily walk, yoga, swimming, or any activity you enjoy will help. Exercise reduces stress, improves focus, and gives you mental clarity to solve complex problems.</p>

            <p>Maintain healthy sleep patterns. When you're tired, decision-making deteriorates, and you become less effective. Going to bed at a reasonable hour is an investment in the quality of your work the next day.</p>

            <p>Set boundaries between work and personal life. When you're off work, truly disconnect. Don't check emails at night unless it's an emergency. Take your vacation days. Spend time with family and friends. Pursue hobbies that have nothing to do with SAP.</p>

            <p>Watch out for burnout. The signs include constant fatigue, loss of motivation, cynicism towards work, and reduced effectiveness. If you notice these signs, take action—reduce your workload, take time off, or consider changing your project situation. Your health is more important than any project.</p>

            <p>Finally, remember that being a good consultant isn't just about technical expertise or skills. It's about being a good professional and an even better human. Take care of yourself so you can bring your best self to work and to all the people around you.</p>

            <p>With these 10 skills and characteristics, I believe you have a solid foundation to succeed in the EWM consulting world. Master them, practice them, and refine them continuously. Your journey as an EWM consultant is a marathon, not a sprint. Enjoy the ride!</p>

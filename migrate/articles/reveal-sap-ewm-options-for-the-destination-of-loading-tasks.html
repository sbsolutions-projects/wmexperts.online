<h1>Reveal SAP EWM</h1><h2>Options for the destination of loading tasks</h2><p>This blog focuses on the outbound loading process which is used for the last movement of a given handling unit, before it leaves the warehouse (physically &amp; logically).<br />I will explain three different options provided by the standard in order to determine the <u>destination</u> of the EWM loading warehouse task. EWM always offers more than you expect so I assume that also in this context, there are some additional options that I am not aware of :-).</p><p>Note that I have not considered any additional options that might evolve out of a TM integration or the new features being delivered based on ASR. I assume most of you are dealing with the loading process in EWM without being integrated into TM. </p><p>…a rough <b>agenda</b>, before we start with the details:<br />- Simple vs. Complex loading<br />- Preconditions for complex loading<br />- Creation of loading tasks<br />- Options for the destination determination<br />- Interesting findings/discoveries<br />- Options for enhancements</p><p>When we are talking about loading warehouse tasks, we are always talking about a ‘complex loading’ process. In contrast do this, with a ‘simple loading’ process we do only set the status/timestamps on the TU/delivery without creating &amp; confirming specific warehouse tasks for the loading process.<br />For the purpose of this blog, we will look at the ‘complex loading’ process only. Pre-condition to make use of this is the usage of the process-oriented storage control (POSC). Without an external process step with the internal step of type ‘LOAD’, you will not be able to create loading warehouse tasks at all:</p>

		Loading WTs in the context of the POSC can be created automatically based on the Auto-WT creation flag of the previous step in the storage process (which is usually not done due to the reason laid out in the highlighted example given by the screenshot below):

		The creation of the loading WT can also be triggered automatically based on a PPF action which is scheduled by a status change when the TU arrives at the door:

		<p>All of those options will not be explored in detail within this blog as we do not want to focus on the creation itself but rather on the determination of the destination for the given tasks.<br />This external storage process step of the storage process is the starting point for our 3 options for the determination of the loading task destination.</p><p><b>Rules-based vs. non rules-based</b><br />First of all we need to differentiate between rules-based and non rules-based determination of the destination.</p>

		<p>Based on this we know now that a rule-based <a href="https://wmexperts.online/work-center-determination-deconsolidation/">determination work</a> of the destination data can be used for some of the process steps. Honestly – that help text here does not help at all. At least not when you are just starting your EWM journey. The web-help (help.sap.com) does also not offer anything helpful here (at least not at the time of writing this blog post). Thus, we have to take it into our own hands again.<br />One important point upfront, before we look into the details –<br />For the outbound loading step, EWM uses the rules-based flag in order to determine the destination of the actual step. Only for the unloading and for the loading steps we are determining the destination for the actual step with the data from the given external step. For all other step types we are actually determining the destination data for the previous external step (e.g. packing work center for the destination of the picking step). This is important to understand from my point of view!<br />What all types of POSC steps types have in common though, is the spot in the code where the respective logic is being called. Function module /SCWM/STORAGE_CONTROL_P_GET is the most important player here. Before we take a deep dive here, let us quickly look at the non rules-based approach.</p><p><b>The non rules-based option</b><br />As one could expect – this is the easy one.<br />Option #1 for the determination of the destination for the loading task:<br />The destination data from the external process step.</p><p>With this approach you simply unflag the rules-based option and provide the destination as part of the POSC step data:</p><p> </p>

		<p>Theoretically that also works with the storage type only (along with the customizing for the generic putaway WTs (‘2’) for the storage type), but the standard RF loading dialog does only support the confirmation of loading WTs with generic destination via CHBD exception. The latter does only work in case you have multiple possible doors for loading / docking the TU. If this is not the case, you will receive an error message:</p>

		<p><strong>The rules-based options</strong></p><p>In case the rule-based flag is active, the destination data given in POSC-step customizing will be ignored.

		<p><strong>Interesting notes</strong></p><p>#1<br />The standard RF dialog will always display the bin of the active door as the destination. Even in case EWM could determine a TU for the HU and the WT is created with the TU as the destination. It is not possible to load to a TU in case the HU is not arrived/assigned to an active door (S&amp;R Door Activity).</p>

		<p><strong>Closure</strong></p><p>As mentioned above already, if the FM mentioned above could neither find a TU, nor a door, it throws an error and does not create a loading task at all. Thus, the step is not supposed to be skipped, in case the rules-based destination determination could not determine a destination (like it is e.g. done with other process step types)).</p><p><strong>Options for enhancements</strong></p><p>Badi to determine destination bin for storage process step: /SCWM/EX_CORE_PSC_PROCESS</p><ul><li>At the end of the FM /SCWM/STORAGE_CONTROL_P_GET EWM calls Badi /SCWM/EX_CORE_PSC_PROCESS which can be used to implement your very own rules-based determination of the destination data for the given POSC step</li></ul><p>Badi for staging bin determination of delivery items: /SCWM/EX_SR_STADET</p><ul><li>This Badi is called at the end of method /SCWM/IF_AF_SR_CONFIG~DETERMINE_STAGING_AREA_OUTB (so after the standard bin determination for the delivery item has been processed) and also at the end of method /SCWM/CL_SR_CONFIG-STAGE_AREA_DET_OUT (so after the standard bin determination based on the TU has been processed):</li></ul>

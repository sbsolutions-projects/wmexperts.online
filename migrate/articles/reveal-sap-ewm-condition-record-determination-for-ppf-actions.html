<h1>Reveal SAP EWM</h1><h2>Condition record determination for PPF actions</h2><p>Within this blog post I take a look into the technical part of condition record determination for PPF action schedule and start conditions. So on a high-level I will basically answer the question about how to get from a condition record to a scheduled or executed action?</p>

		<p>As a practical example I decided to take the determination in the context of action conditions for delivery documents. A very similar approach is valid for any other PPF application in EWM which is using condition records in order to schedule or start its actions (e.g. actions on Handling Unit, Physical Inventory Document or Warehouse Order -level in the area of the ‘Warehouse Management Engine’).</p><p>You can expect answers to the following technical questions within this blog post:</p><ul><li>Where does EWM call the condition record determination (some examples)?</li><li>What needs to be done in order to implement a custom logic to consider additional fields?</li><li>How does EWM compare the given object with the given condition records?</li></ul><p>Logical flow of the process that I will tackle within this post:</p>

		<p>Condition records in the context of PPF actions in EWM are being evaluated for schedule and start conditions. As the name says – these conditions decide whether a given action is to be scheduled at all and whether it should be executed right away or not. The logic behind those conditions is defined via implementations of the BAdi EVAL_SCHEDCOND_PPF (for schedule conditions) and EVAL_STARTCOND_PPF (for start conditions) respectively:</p>

		<p>As mentioned above, with this blog post I want to focus on how EWM implements conditions based on condition records. For this purpose it is neither relevant whether those records are evaluated in the context of a schedule or a start conditions. Nor is it relevant whether those records are being evaluated in the context of scheduling for the application area of ‘Warehouse Requests’, ‘Warehouse Management Engine’ or any other area. Of course the approach of collecting data ahead of reading the condition tables is slightly different but I will come to this once we reach that point. For now, let us concentrate on our example in the context of <u>scheduling an action for a warehouse request</u>.</p><p>We take the action for the automatic GR posting of inbound deliveries. Via transaction SPPFCADM we can find a filter value which is assigned to a PPF action. The filter is used during runtime in order to determine the relevant implementation of the BAdis shown above (so in case you want to implement your own scheduling logic, you only need to create a new implementation of the BAdi and assign a different filter value here):</p>

		<p>There are lots of other examples for implementations where this method is being called but the one above should be enough for now to have a good understanding of the context. So what is our EVALUATE method actually doing here?</p><p>Looking at it from the outside, this method is responsible to fill its return variable rv_cv. The variable is filled based on the result of the condition record determination in the following way:</p>

		<p><em>From technical point of view, there is a big difference between the schedule and start condition. On the one hand, schedule conditions use data from memory and are evaluated before the main process updates the database from the memory. On the other hand, start conditions are evaluated when the database is already updated and they use data from there. (SAP Note 1461585)</em></p><p>Thus, checking the schedule conditions means checking the transient object states. Checking the start conditions means checking the persistent object states. Schedule conditions use status changes, which are calculated from the status in the database and the status in the memory. Start conditions read the status in the database once the main process is completed.</p><p>In general it is always better to use start conditions in case any kind of status is involved as with the calculation during runtime for schedule conditions EWM sometimes does not load all items of the delivery into the memory (e.g. it calculates based on one item only which might not necessarily lead to the correct result on header level). For further details about the status calculation I recommend reading SAP note 1461585.</p><p>A quick look into the other application areas before we close this 2<sup>nd</sup> step. We learned now that for warehouse requests the object-related data for the relevant search fields is collected via method /SCWM/CL_DLV_PPF_CONF -CREATE_REQUESTS. For the other application areas the approach is quite similar  –</p><ul><li>Handling Unit related PPF actions<ul><li>The interface method of the condition evaluation BAdi calls function module /SCWM/SCHEDULE_COND_HU</li><li>This FM determines the search fields and fills the application data into the condition record search fields</li></ul></li><li>Physical Inventory related PPF actions<ul><li>The interface method of the condition evaluation BAdi directly determines the search fields and fills the application data into the condition record search fields</li></ul></li><li>Warehouse order related PPF actions<ul><li>The interface method of the condition evaluation BAdi calls function module /SCWM/SCHEDULE_COND_WO</li><li>This FM determines the search fields and fills the application data into the condition record search fields</li></ul></li></ul><p><u>Fill fields which are not filled via standard logic</u></p>

		<p>Function module IPC_CT_CNF_DETERMINE_MULTI is the most important player in this context. It is being used to read condition records in the context of all different applications mentioned in this blog post (~ for warehouse requests and in the same way for HU, WO or PI related actions).</p>

		<p>I do not want to dig deep into the content of this function module. A detailed code-review does not add any value here from my perspective. In summary - it compares the imported data listed above with the values in the condition records of the relevant condition tables. The result is returned via table lt_result (see screenshot above). It is then further processed/evaluated in order to set the value of the return variable of the evaluation method and subsequently the parameter EP_RC in the interface method of the BAdi for the schedule or start condition.</p><p>Remember the screenshots that I showed you at the beginning of this post already:</p>
